v0.2.9 -29 Dec 2011 (commit 7d7fe0ee30)
--------------------
 - Only update host table on ARP entry state == REACHABLE (avoids insertion when MAC is still being resolved).


v0.2.8 -21 Dec 2011
--------------------

    - Build fixes for Ubuntu Oneiric Ocelot


v0.2.7 -12 Dec 2011
--------------------
    - Fixed ethernet rule matching
    - Add commandline argument parsing; L2-matching via -m


v0.2.6 -08 Dec 2011
--------------------
    - rfslave: don't die when server connection is lost
    - Fixed bug where joining VM wouldn't adopt an idle DP
    - Standardise output for VMid/DPid to hexidecimal "0x..." format
    - Switched all output to Syslog in the rf-slave


v0.2.5 -07 Dec 2011
--------------------
    - Install BGP,ICMP flows to DP when a VM joins and associates with it.


v0.2.4 -06 Dec 2011
--------------------
   - Refactored to consolidate send_ovs_flow() code into send_flow_msg()
   - Fixed names of RFO_CLEAR_FLOW_TABLE


v0.2.3 -05 Dec 2011
--------------------
   - Refactored OF mod matching/wildcard code
   - Refactored OF flowmod action code
   - Rename ofm functions to match flow wildcard naming convention
   - Refactored OF flowmod command code


v0.2.2 -02 Dec 2011
--------------------
   - De-clutter syslog a bit
  - RFOperations renamed to RFO_foo for easier refactoring
  - When a datapath joins, send it flow entries for ARP,ICMP,BGP
   - Fix to invalid assignment of string -> char * in the rf-slave


v0.2.1 - 25 Nov 2011
--------------------
     - Patch to deal with VLAN tags add by the switch 
v0.2.0 - 12 Oct 2011
--------------------
    - Fixes to multipath handling code. Former fix dealt with attribute iterating, but the outer for (RTNH) was still causing headaches.


v0.1.9 - 06 Oct 2011
--------------------
  - Fixed slave segmentation fault when deleting route from the Route list.
    - Removed handling of RTM_DELNEIGH. When that kind of entry expires we shouldn't do anything, because the flow in the datapath is configured to expire in a certain ammount of time
    - Multipath handling corrected. Gateway gathering was looping through rtnhp_ptr and setting inconsistent data.


v0.1.8 - 04 Oct 2011
--------------------
    - Conditional variable added to handle race condition when accessing the command queue.


v0.1.7 - 01 Oct 2011
--------------------
    - Corrected and added code for dealing with multipath routes
(RTA_MULTIPATH). 
    - Mockup of log facilities were also added, just to the point where it could help the former implementation.
    - The routes to directly attached networks MUST NOT be installed to the flow table.


v0.1.6 - 23 Sep 2011
--------------------
    - NOX crashes caused by  race condition when calling send_openflow_packet() from a non-cooperative thread (RF-Controller) is solved.
    - Memory leaks in RF-Server corrected.
    - dependency of NOX::Discovery on RF-Controller removed.


v0.1.5 - 20 Sep 2011
--------------------
    - Reception method of RF-Protocol causing "Broken pipe" fixed


v0.1.4 - 06 Sep 2011
--------------------
    - New debug messages in rf-slave for NetLink events.


v0.1.3 - 29 Aug 2011
--------------------
    - Routes to directly attached networks MUST NOT be installed to the flow table.


v0.1.2 - 22 Aug 2011
--------------------
    - Changed rf-server TCP socket mode to "blocking" to avoid wasting CPU time unnecessarily.

   - Thread responsible for handle messagens from VMs is set sleep when there is no VM connected.


v0.1.1 - 09 Jun 2011
--------------------
    - Flows installed with incorrect MAC address
    - Now all the VM interfaces have the same ethernet MAC address.


v0.1.0 - 17 May 2011
--------------------
    - Initial release
